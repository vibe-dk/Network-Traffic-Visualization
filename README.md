# Network-Traffic-Visualization

## Outline

This Python project empowers the perception of organization traffic information on topographical guides in Keyhole Markup Language (KML) design.It is an important device for network overseers and security investigators to acquire bits of knowledge into network associations.

## Highlights

- **Robotized IP Geolocation:** Recover public IP addresses and perform IP geolocation.
- **Parcel Parsing:** Catch and parse network bundles from pcap documents.
- **KML Generation:** Create KML placemarks and lines for perception.
- **Customization:** Alter geolocation information sources to suit your necessities.
- **Cross-Stage Compatibility:** Works flawlessly on different working frameworks.

## Getting Started

  Comply with these rules to prepare a copy of the errand on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries
    >dpkt
    >pygeoip 
    >requests
- GeoLiteCity- https://github.com/mbcc2006/GeoLiteCity-data

# Installation

- pip install dpkt pygeoip requests

# Usage
- Ensure you have a pcap file (e.g., 'packets.pcap') containing network traffic data.
- Run the script, and it will generate a KML file ('sample.kml') with network traffic visualizations.

# Run
- python packet-tracer.py

# Customization
You can customize geolocation data sources by modifying the script to use different databases.
